# dgareg

A tool to identify dga based domains queried by botnet-infected systems.
This tool to identify botnets that use domain-generation-algorithms "learns" how domains are written and tries to identify differences from the norm and to flag them as suspicious.
Other tasks are made to make more profound statements linke DNS related assumptions.
